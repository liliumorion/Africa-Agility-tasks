        ALICE AUGUSTA BALL was the first woman to graduate from
        <b>the College of Hawaii</b> (now the University of Hawaii) in
        <b>1915 </b>with a master’s degree in science (chemistry). She was the
        first African American research chemist and instructor in the college’s
        chemistry department. Alice Ball was also the first person to
        successfully develop a water-soluble, injectable form of chaulmoogra oil
        that was used for decades to relieve the symptoms of Hansen’s disease
        (leprosy).
      </p>
      <p>
        Born July 24, 1892, in Seattle, Washington, Alice Ball grew up around
        chemicals.<br />
        After graduating from Seattle High School in 1910, she spent four years
        at the University of Washington and earned two degrees: pharmaceutical
        chemistry (1912) and pharmacy (1914).
      </p>
      <p>
        Before departing to Hawaii for graduate school, she co-published with
        her pharmacy instructor a 10-page article in the prestigious Journal of
        the American Chemical Society. While completing her master’s thesis, The
        Chemical Constituents of Piper Methysticum; or The Chemical Constituents
        of the Active Principle of the Ava Root, Dr. Hollmann, Assistant Surgeon
        at Kalihi Hospital in Hawaii where new Hansen’s disease patients were
        sent, asked Alice Ball to help him isolate the active agents in
        chaulmoogra oil. In a short period of time, she accomplished what many
        researchers, chemists, and pharmacologists working around the world for
        hundreds of years had not been able to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sadly, Alice never lived to witness the results of her discovery. On
        December 31, 1916, she died at the age of twenty-four. A 1918 article in
        the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) reported that 78
        patients of Kalihi Hospital were released by board of health examiners
        after being treated by chaulmoogra injections.
      </p>
      <p>
        For almost eighty-five years, the amazing life and accomplishments of
        Alice Augusta Ball seemed lost in the pages of time. On February 29,
        2000, the University of Hawaii recognized its first woman graduate and
        pioneering chemist with a bronze plaque mounted at the base of the lone
        chaulmoogra tree on campus.
